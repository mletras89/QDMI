Ready to contribute to QDMI? This guide will help you get started.

## Initial Setup

1. Fork the [QDMI](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/QDMI) repository on GitHub (see
   <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>).

2. Clone your fork locally

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/QDMI.git
   ```

3. Change into the project directory

   ```sh
   cd QDMI
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development

   ```sh
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. (Optional, **highly recommended**) Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically
   run a set of checks before each commit.

   <div class="tabbed">

   - <b class="tab-title">via `uv`</b> The easiest way to install pre-commit is via
     [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

     \code{.sh} uv tool install pre-commit \endcode

   - <b class="tab-title">via `brew`</b> If you use macOS, then pre-commit is in Homebrew, use

     \code{.shell} brew install pre-commit \endcode

   - <b class="tab-title">via `pipx`</b> If you prefer to use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/),
     you can install pre-commit with

     \code{.shell} pipx install pre-commit \endcode

   - <b class="tab-title">via `pip`</b> If you prefer to use regular `pip` (preferably in a virtual
     environment), you can install pre-commit with

     \code{.shell} pip install pre-commit \endcode

   </div>
   Afterwards, you can install the pre-commit hooks with

   \code{.shell} pre-commit install \endcode

## Working on Source Code

Building the project requires a C compiler supporting _C11_ and a minimum CMake version of _3.19_.
The example devices and the tests require a C++ compiler supporting _C++17_.

### Configure and Build

QDMI uses CMake as its build system. Building a project using CMake is a two-step process:

First, the project needs to be _configured_ by calling

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

This tells CMake to generate the build system in the `build` directory for a release build.

After the configuration, the project can be _built_ by calling

```shell
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Running Tests

We use the [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) framework for unit testing
of the QDMI interface. All tests are contained in the `test` directory. After building the project
(as described above), the C++ unit tests can be conveniently executed by running

```shell
ctest -C Release --test-dir build
```

from the main project directory.

### Code Formatting and Linting

This project mostly follows the [LLVM Coding Standard](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html),
which is a set of guidelines for writing C/C++ code. To ensure the quality of the code and that it
conforms to these guidelines, we use

- [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) -- a static analysis tool that checks for
  common mistakes in C/C++ code, and
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) -- a tool that automatically formats
  C/C++ code according to a given style guide.

Common IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) have plugins that can automatically run clang-tidy on the
code and automatically format it with clang-format.

- If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install the
  [clangd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).
- If you are using CLion, you can configure the project to use the `.clang-tidy` and `.clang-format`
  files in the project root directory.

They will automatically execute clang-tidy on your code and highlight any issues. In many cases,
they also provide quick-fixes for these issues. Furthermore, they provide a command to automatically
format your code according to the given style.

\note After configuring CMake, you can run clang-tidy on a file by calling
`clang-tidy <FILE> -- -I <PATH_TO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORY>` where `<FILE>` is the file you want to analyze
and `<PATH_TO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORY>` is the path to the `include` directory of the project.

### Format for Comments

For the information to be displayed correctly in the documentation, it is essential that the
comments follow the format required by Doxygen. Below you find some tags, that are commonly used
within the documentation of a function:

- `@brief` For a brief, one-line description of the function. Should always be provided.
- `@details` For a longer, detailed description of the function.
- `@param` To explain the usage of a parameter. Should be provided for each parameter.
- `@return` To explain the return value. Should be provided if the function returns a value.

\note In the current setting, the long description is always prepended with the brief description.
So there is no need to repeat the brief description in the details.

## Working on the Documentation

The documentation is generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html), which is
seamlessly integrated into the CMake build system.

### Building the Documentation

The documentation can be built with the CMake target `qdmi_docs` via

```shell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --target qdmi_docs
```

The generated webpage can be inspected by opening the file in `docs/html/index.html` in the CMake
build directory.

### Static Content

The generated webpage also contains four static sites, namely the main page, the support page, the
FAQ page, and this development guide. The respective markdown files that serve as the source for
those sites are contained in `docs/` where `index.md` contains the content of the main page.

### Dynamic Content

In order to include source files to be listed among the menu item `API Reference/Files`, these files
must be marked as documented. This is accomplished by adding a comment like the following to the top
of the file. Right now, this is done for all files in the include directory.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
\verbatim

/** @file
 * @brief Include all public headers for the QDMI client.
 * @details The detailed description of the interface is provided in
 * @ref client/control.h and @ref client/query.h.
 */

\endverbatim
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
